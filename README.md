Project Title:
COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

Short Description:
This project involves analyzing global COVID-19 data to understand trends in case numbers, deaths, and vaccination rollouts across different countries. The dataset is obtained from reliable sources such as Our World in Data and Johns Hopkins University. Using Python tools like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualize trends, and derive key insights about how the pandemic unfolded globally. The final results are presented in a Jupyter Notebook format, combining code, visualizations, and narrative explanations.

Objectives of the Project:
Data Import & Cleaning: Load and clean COVID-19 data from trusted sources.

Trend Analysis: Analyze and visualize time trends in total cases, deaths, and vaccinations.

Comparison Across Countries/Regions: Compare COVID-19 metrics across countries like India, USA, and Kenya.

Visualize Data: Create insightful visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and optionally choropleth maps.

Reporting Insights: Summarize key findings and insights, including patterns, anomalies, and trends, using markdown explanations.

List of Tools and Libraries Used:
pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

matplotlib: For data visualization (line charts, bar charts, etc.).

seaborn: For creating visually appealing statistical charts (optional).

plotly (optional): For interactive visualizations like choropleth maps.

Jupyter Notebook: The environment for coding and presenting the project.

Python 3.x: Programming language used for analysis and visualization.

How to Run/View the Project:
Install Jupyter Notebook: If you don't have Jupyter installed, you can install it via Anaconda or pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install jupyterlab
Install Required Libraries: Ensure that pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly are installed. You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
Run the Notebook:

Open your terminal/command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where your notebook is stored.

Type jupyter notebook and press Enter.

Open the notebook file (.ipynb) in the browser.

Run Each Cell: You can execute each code cell individually by selecting the cell and pressing Shift + Enter. This will display the outputs (graphs and data) below each cell.

Export to PDF (Optional):

After completing the analysis and ensuring everything works, you can export the notebook as a PDF by going to File > Download as > PDF via LaTeX.

Insights & Reflections:
Vaccination Programs: The analysis clearly shows the significant role of vaccination programs in controlling the spread of COVID-19. Countries that had early access to vaccines (like the USA) saw a faster reduction in daily cases and deaths.

Case Trends in India: Indiaâ€™s second wave (around May 2021) caused a sharp rise in cases, highlighting the importance of healthcare infrastructure in managing surges.

Kenya's Vaccination Rollout: Kenya's slow vaccination start was improved by global collaboration and continued efforts, showing the impact of external support in lower-income countries.

Global Patterns: A noticeable decline in COVID-19 cases after mid-2021 correlates with global vaccination efforts. However, the uneven distribution of vaccines remains a key challenge in many regions.
